# Plague

Hello, 
I have developed a small game during a Game Jam this past January. 
I'd like to continue working on it periodically and updating it.

I'll document everything here.

Small Description: Welcome to Night Of The Plague. You are Dude who is supporting NYC's most feared super villain, Vector. Vector's evil plans get delayed by beloved super hero Mr. FuzzyMan. Vector needs your help to make his evil plan a reality. Type the words on the fire balls Mr. FuzzyMan throws to help Vector!

To Do List:

 For now, enjoy.
